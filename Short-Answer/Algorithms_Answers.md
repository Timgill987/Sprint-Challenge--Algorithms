#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because the assignments are constant, and the while is linear


b) O(n^2) because the assignments are linear and the nested while loop is linear and we multiply that with the parent for loop to get O(n^2)


c) O(n) because the function def, assignment and return are all constant, but the last return is recursing through all bunnies.

## Exercise II

egg either breaks or does not break.
we can go to the middle of n-story building to cut the length of our search in half
and work our way down. or up depending if the egg breaks on the middle floor.
O( log n)

(lets be real, eggs gonna break if you drop it.) :p
